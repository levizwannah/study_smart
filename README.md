# study_smart
A system to help students organize tasks.

Currently the system helps students only remember what they are to do. this makes it have less info for each task because the assumption is that a student knows what they are to do, they just need to be reminded.  
We think that a student doesn't need to rewrite the task, if they want to, there are other tools out there. This one is to just keep them reminded. 

# functionalities needed
- Sharing: Students should be able to share assignments with each other, with everyone maintaining their own version of the tasks, if necessary.
- Class creation: In school, there are classes which have similar assignments. When someone adds an assignment or group work to a class, it should be seen by everyone. 
- PWA
- Android webview implementation
- Swift webview implementation
